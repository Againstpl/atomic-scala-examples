Atomic Scala Examples
=====================

Examples from the book "Atomic Scala" by Bruce Eckel &amp; Dianne Marsh. Also 
includes the necessary code to make it work within Typesafe Activator.

When you download this package (see the "download as zip" button on the right),
you'll get a package with a number of directories; the only one you need to follow
the book examples is the one titled "examples". You can ignore the rest of the files
and directories, which are used by Activator.

Within the "examples" directory you will find all the example files from the book, 
as well as several build scripts (one for each platform):

  - Testall.bat for Windows command shell
  - Testall.ps1 for Windows PowerShell
  - Testall.sh for Macintosh and Linux

Full instructions on installation and use are in the book itself.
